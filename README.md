Rebuilding the Goolge home page

The plan is to use Chome Dev Tools to deconstruct the website and try and build it on my own
working links is a plus but not necessary. I tried this before in '17 and stopped working on this project. I am not picking up where I left off and will finisht his to compeletion. Yee!


# the plan is to learn the below topics:
-Two ways to move a div around on the page
-Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
-Identify the background color of an existing webpage
-Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
-Center an element horizontally
-Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
-Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
-Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)

At the end of this project I'll loop back and see if I've learned them all.
